What do you think is a particularly good use case for LLMs for science? How would you evaluate it?

Use for literature review:
        LLMs can be used to summarize and extract from a large number of papers. 
        This can be extremely for researchers who are trying to understand the current state of the field, 
        or for students who are trying to get a sense of the literature on a particular topic. They can also be used to obtain references for a particular topic. 
        This will be useful to researchers/academicians in any field of study.
    
Evaluation:
    - Can compare the quality of the summaries generated by LLMs to those generated by humans. Could potentially use the comments of original referees of the papers
    to evaluate the quality of the summaries. [Issues of privacy and confidentiality, requires manually labeled dataset]
    - Check for the correctness of the references obtained by the LLM. [semi-automated, can check for relevance of the provided reference to the topic]
    - Could use a larger LLM to evaluate the results of a smaller, more specialized LLM.
